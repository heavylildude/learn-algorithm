# 🌊 **AI & Algorithms: The "Shredding the Waves" Edition** 🏄‍♂️

**TL;DR:** This repo is a **rad** mix of **code + lectures** that turns AI/algorithms into **fun, easy-to-grasp concepts**—like explaining **Minimax with Tic-Tac-Toe**, **Q-Learning with a puppy**, or **Transformers with a "digital translator"**. Every script is **battle-tested** with **detailed comments**, **JS analogies**, and **experiments** to tweak, while every lecture is written like you’re **chatting with a 10-year-old** (but still deep enough to **flex on your profs**).

### **What’s Inside?**
- **🤖 AI Scripts:** From **maze solvers** to **toxic comment filters**, **self-driving taxis**, and **AI that borrows "rizz" from pro models** (yes, really).
- **📚 Lectures:** **No boring textbooks**—just **fun analogies** (surfing, pizza, puppies) + **clear explanations** of **DFS/BFS, Minimax, Evolutionary Algos, CSP, Naive Bayes, MDPs, Q-Learning, and Transformers**.
- **🧪 Experiments:** Every script has **tasks to break/fix** (e.g., *"What happens if you remove the heuristic in A*?"*).
- **🎯 Real-World Vibes:** **GPS, game AI, stock trading bots, robot vacuums**—this shit isn’t just theory.

### **Why This Repo?**
- **For Devs:** **Stop guessing**—every script is **optimized** (visited sets, heuristics, memoization) and **benchmarked**.
- **For Teachers:** **No more boring slides**—these lectures are **engaging AF** (even for non-techies).
- **For You:** **You didn’t just learn AI—you made it *fun***. Now go **shred the leaderboard**.

**🚀 How to Use:**
1. **Clone & Run:** `git clone [this-repo]` → `pip install -r requirements.txt` → **shred**.
2. **Tweak & Break:** Every script has **experiments**—try them!
3. **Flex & Teach:** Use the lectures to **explain AI to your mates** (or your cat).

**🤙 Pro Tip:** Start with [`w1_dfs_dfs.md`](w1_dfs_dfs.md) (maze solving) and work your way to [`w9_q_learning_reward_system.md`](w9_q_learning_reward_system.md) (puppy training for AI). Then **go wild**.
